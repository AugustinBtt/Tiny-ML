 TinyML enables the deployment of lightweight ML models on resource-constrained devices like microcontrollers, bringing intelligence to everyday objects. Embedded systems are specialized computing platforms that power everything from smart gadgets to industrial machines. By combining TinyML with these systems, we can create smart, low-power devices capable of processing data locally and making autonomous decisions.
